# Diamond Diary

**Diamond Diary** is a desktop application built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and React/TypeScript, designed to manage diamond inventory efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface to add, edit, delete, and print diamond entries, with automatic backups for data safety. Perfect for diamond merchants or businesses needing a lightweight, secure, and fast solution.

## Features

- **Add Entries**: Easily input diamond details like Issue Date, Kapan No., Packet No., Rough Weight, Cut, Polish Weight, Shape, Rate, Deposit Date, Total, and Remarks.
- **Edit & Delete**: Update or remove existing entries with a simple click (Edit/Delete buttons).
- **Data Persistence**: Entries are saved locally and persist across app restarts.
- **Automatic Backups**: Backups are created automatically in `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\DiamondDiary\` as JSON files (`backup_<timestamp>.json` and `merchant_backup_<timestamp>.json`).
- **Print Functionality**: Print diamond entries in a clean table format with borders (Action column excluded in print).
- **Totals Display**: View total Rough Weight and Grand Total at the bottom of the table.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with modern CSS (via `index.css`) for a sleek and intuitive experience.
- **Cross-Platform Ready**: Currently built for Windows, with potential for macOS/Linux support via Tauri.
